# ESP32_ULTRASONIC_BLYNK
This project uses an ESP32 and an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and display the data on the Blynk IoT platform. The sensor calculates distance using sound wave travel time, while the ESP32 connects via WiFi to send real-time data to a virtual dashboard, enabling remote monitoring and smart automation.
